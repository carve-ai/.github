## PCMF, LL-PCMF, & P3CA: Simple and Scalable Algorithms for Cluster‚ÄëAware Embedding (Introduced in Buch, Liston, Grosenick. AISTATS 2024)

**PCMF** (Pathwise Clustered Matrix Factorization), **LL‚ÄëPCMF** (Locally Linear PCMF), **P3CA** (Pathwise Clustered Canonical Correlation Analysis), and **Consensus PCMF** are modular algorithms that combine low‚Äërank embedding with a convex clustering penalty to produce **cluster‚Äëaware** low-rank representations for single‚Äëview and two‚Äëview data.

[AISTATS 2024 Repository with PCMF_P3CA package.](https://github.com/carve-ai/PCMF_P3CA)

These methods are introduced in:  
**Amanda M. Buch, Conor Liston, Logan Grosenick.** *Simple and scalable algorithms for cluster‚Äëaware precision medicine.* AISTATS 2024 (PMLR 238:136‚Äì144).  
Paper: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v238/buch24a.html

The original algorithms and software were developed by Dr. Amanda Buch and Dr. Logan Grosenick.  
This release was refactored, prepared, and packaged by Dr. Buch for easy implementation, and replicates the software, algorithms, and results reported in the AISTATS 2024 paper.

Please contact Dr. Buch with any inquiries:
